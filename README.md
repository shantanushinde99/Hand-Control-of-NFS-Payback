### Hi there 👋 Welcome to My Project  

# **🎮🚗 Hand Gesture Control for NFS Game 🚗🎮**  

One of my most exciting projects is **Hand Gesture Control for the NFS (Need for Speed) Game**, which redefines how players interact with gaming systems. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, this project creates an immersive and intuitive gameplay experience.

---

### **📖 Overview**  
This system allows players to control a car in the game using **hand gestures**. By leveraging **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning** techniques, the system captures and interprets finger and hand movements, transforming them into commands for actions like steering, acceleration, braking, and more.  

---

### **🌟 Key Features**  
- **🛞 Steering Control**: Move your hand left or right to steer the car with precision.  
- **⏩ Accelerate and Brake**: Specific gestures or finger positions are mapped to these actions, enabling seamless speed adjustments.  
- **🤏 Gesture Recognition**: High-accuracy tracking of hand gestures ensures responsive and reliable controls.  
- **🎮 Intuitive Gameplay**: Eliminates the need for traditional controllers, offering a unique and engaging way to play.
